This is an app for explore and download posts on e621.net. It uses e621's API and it's powered by Vue.js. Feel free to contribute to this project!

### :thought_balloon: Keep in mind...
* This app interacts with a NSFW site, so, if you don't like to see explicit content... use `rating:s` while you are searching posts.
* Posts (images, animations, videos) are from e621, some are uploaded by his own artist.
